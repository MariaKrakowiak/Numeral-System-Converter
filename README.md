# Numeral-System-Converter

## Description

Let's face it: errors happen. What if someone enters the wrong radix? What if the input number is impossible to convert to the given radix? What if the number is not a number at all?

In this final stage, we will make sure the program can handle errors like that. At this point, you can implement this without the try catch construction. Use the following rule of thumb: if you can avoid exception-based logic, avoid it!

So, the goal here is to implement error messages when the input is wrong.

This stage is auto-graded. The grader will input some data. Then it will check that the last line of your program output contains the word "error" if the input is wrong.

If the input is correct, your program should behave as in the previous stage.
